## What is the name of your Guild?

Sentnl



## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

- We have upgraded all our Nodeos instances to the emergency patch.


## Usage statistics for API nodes (Hyperion & Atomic)

- Our statistics run via collectd which pushes to Grafana but it stopped working for our Hyperion in Feb and we only reliased now.
- Below are some statisics prior to it stopping.
- We generally average about 800 reqests per hour
- Unique visiors not currently configured, but will look into how this can be added to haprpoxy logging.
- Also we will look into configuring haproxy with two proxies so we can log v1 & v2 requests seperately. 


### chat.sentnl.io

An implementation of a AI hosted chatbot designed to facilitate questions and answers around the EOS documentation. 

**Next steps:**

- Integrate all Stack Exchange data and offer answers as a supplementary resource alongside the existing EOS documentation site.
- Develop a widget that enables WAX or EOSIO documentation websites to seamlessly incorporate the chat functionality.
- Provide an easily installable Docker container, allowing the WAX team to deploy the service and integrate it into their documentatin site.
- Potential to create a discord or telegram bot also.



### Github CI smart contract vulnerability scanners for EOSIO and ETH

https://github.com/Sentnl/EOSIO-Vulnerability-Scanner

https://github.com/Sentnl/Solidity-Vulnerability-Scanner

Both of these tools establish a connection with the OpenAI API, examining all C++ or Solidity files within your GitHub repository for potential vulnerabilities related to EOSIO and ETH Smart contracts. The present workflow is designed to execute subsequent to each push request.



### 1. Security Audits

- **Security Audit:** 

We continue working on our automated security scanner called  called Sengine.


**The current workflow is as following**

- A Guild logs in using the Anchor wallet.
- The Guild adds domains they wish to scan.
- The Guild selects a domain to scan.
- After completing the scan, vulnerabilities associated with all discovered subdomains are listed.


**Current tools and vulnerabilities checked for.**

- Subfinder, gawk: Identify all subdomains associated with a domain.
- Nuclei: Features thousands of templates for scanning various protocols (TCP, DNS, HTTP, SSL, File, Whois, Websocket, Headless, etc.) to detect vulnerabilities.
- Additional tools, such as httpx, nmap, naabu, and chrome headless browser, are integrated to streamline the process.

**Future tools and vulnerability checks to be integrated:**

- Git check: Implement a range of tools to examine GitHub repositories and commit histories, identifying sensitive information or secrets that should not be present.
- XSS check: Integrate an extensive set of tools and tests to detect and evaluate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- WAX Software: Incorporate customized scripts to assess potential security flaws in tools frequently used within the WAX community, including Atomic API, Hyperion, and others.
- SSH audit: Employ a variety of tools to test and audit SSH ports for weaknesses (banner, key exchange, encryption, mac, compression, compatibility, security, etc).

As the product evolves, this list will expand. The goal is to closely replicate our manual audits for a comprehensive security assessment.

Here is an image of the python celery worker working it's way through the various tools to scan each subdomain.

Here is a video of the frontend mechanics. (again it's very basic, but it shows the workflow). We are still working on adding the vulnerabilities page to list all of the vulnerabilities that are saved for each scan from the database.

**UPDATE:**

- No update this month


### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:

- Get a working MVP launched



### 2. Automated Guild Rating system

- **URL:** https://wax.sengine.co 
- **Github:** https://github.com/ankh2054/oig-portal/

**Some new features added:**

- We have updated the tech scoring system, so we can now accurately predict the tech score. 
- We have implemented a tech score graph, giving producers a graph overview of their tech score over a period of time.

### Milestones for the following 1-2 months:



### 3.  OIG Wiki

- **URL:** https://docs.sentnl.io 
- **Github:** https://github.com/ankh2054/oig-portal/docs/





## Running useful APIs:


### CVE search service

- **URL:**  https://vuln.sentnl.io
- **Github:** https://github.com/ankh2054/CVE-Search-Docker


### Atomic API

- We continue to provide the Atomic API service.

## Creation of original informational content or translation that benefits WAX:

**Sentnl Security Wiki  - https://wiki.sentnl.io**



## Community tools 

We wanted to just touch base on all the tools we have developed for the Guild community:

* Delphi oracle Docker - We created a docker image to easily allow new Guilds get setup with pushing pricing feeds to the oracle.  https://github.com/ankh2054/delphioracle

* Snapshot service Docker and automated website - We created a docker image and ReactJS frontend to automate the setup of a snapshot service for WAX mainnet and testnet.
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshots.sentnl.io
https://github.com/ankh2054/snapshot-service

* Update JSON on chain to refelect bp.json

We created a script that automatically downloads your guilds JSON from your website and pushes it to chain using greymass producerjson contract using cron.

https://github.com/ankh2054/updateJSONtochain

## EOS monitor - We created a EOS node monitoring tool that monitors your nodeos and alerts if if there any issues.

https://github.com/ankh2054/eosmonitor



### Hyperion missing blocks feature - A script that automates finding missing blocks in hyperion.
